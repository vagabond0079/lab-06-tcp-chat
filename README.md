  * ensure that all of your methods have test coverage
  * write tests which start your server, send and receive, and confirm functionality

## Directions
* Create a TCP Server use using the net module
* Create a Client Constructor
* When sockets connect to the server a new `Client` instance should be made
* Clients should have a unique 'nickname'
 * **e.g.** `guest-43`
* When sockets are connected with the ClientPool they should be given event listeners for `data`, `error`, and `close` events
 * When a socket emits the `close` event the socket should be removed from the client pool!
 * When a socket emits the `error` event the error should be logged on the server
 * When a socket emits the `data` event the data should be logged on the server and the `\wack` commands below should be implemented

# Wack commands `'/'`
* `/nick` should allow a user change their nickname
* `/dm` should allow a user to send a message directly to another user by nick name
* when a user speaks their nickname should be printed
 * **i.e.** `teapot: Sup Hacker?`
* `/troll` should take in a number and a message and send the message to everyone that number of times
* `/quit` should close the connection with the user

## Bonus
* 2pts Write a test that tests `\nick` actually changes a clients nickname
